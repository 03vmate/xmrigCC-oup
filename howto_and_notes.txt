config to deploy / notes: 
    
    sample is in src folder (default_config.json) -> currently the same then the miner config.

    miner specific config files have to be stored within the defined folder (defined in config_cc.json), or the root folder of the xmrigCCServer.
 
    the client specific config filename has to be in the format "hostname_config.json" or if alternative worker-id is defined "myworkername_config.json".
    if you dont provide a client specific config, the default_config.json is transfered to the client(miner) if you trigger the "update" action. the client will be automatically restarted, when the config is applied.

running:
    to start the cc server just start xmrigCCServer.
    on the client execute xmrigDaemond (don't run the xmrigMiner it will not start). xmrigDaemon (miner) and xmrigCCServer can be runned on the same machine. xmrigDaemon will automatically connect every 10s to the xmrigCCServer and publish its results and will check for an outstanding command, which will be immediately executed.


xmrigCCServer:

    the dashboard is available via http://ip:port (the port is defined within config_cc.json, per default the port is bound to any available device [0.0.0.0]). You have to login with user/pass (defined in config_cc.json)

    all the webservices return 200 OK as result code, or when there is an error, the specific result code.
